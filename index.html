  Hello, My name is Leslie Canjura and I am currently attending BCC in Berkeley, Ca. and the
Dev Mission program in San Francisco, CA. I am currently pursuing my degree in the education
field hoping to work with children again, and being able to share with them the different things
that they can learn with technology (STEM). I am an outgoing person with eagerness to learn new things. I am responsible and resilient, I am
happy to work in a team but can work independently as well. I believe a great asset I bring to
the table is my interpersonal communications skills.

  I am looking to pursue my career in technology after graduating from the Dev Mission Program;
I believe the program will better support and enhance my skills in technology so I can be a great
candidate for any upcoming technology opportunity.
